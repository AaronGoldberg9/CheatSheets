This repository contains some cheatsheets that I found useful while taking courses 
on quantum mechanics and atomic and molecular physics.
Note that the cheatsheet for the del operator in different coordinate systens
used to be available at [the wikipedia page for the del operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del_in_cylindrical_and_spherical_coordinates)
It is still there but there is no nice pdf ready-to-be-printed version.
