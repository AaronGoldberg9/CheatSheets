This repository contains some cheatsheets that I found useful while taking courses 
on quantum mechanics and atomic and molecular physics.
Note that the cheatsheet for the del operator in different coordinate systems
used to be available at [the wikipedia page for the del operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del_in_cylindrical_and_spherical_coordinates).
It is still there but there is no nice pdf ready-to-be-printed version.

Note that the original file from wikipedia is DelWiki.pdf. This file has a minor typo (the word Operation is misspelled as Operaion). I then converted this file to PostScript and fixed the typo. This is del.ps. Finally I converted this las file to DelFixed.pdf.
